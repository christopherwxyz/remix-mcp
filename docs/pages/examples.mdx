# Examples

Practical examples of using remix-mcp with Claude to create music in Ableton Live.

## Building a track from scratch

```
You: Create a chill lo-fi beat at 85 BPM

Claude: I'll set up a relaxed lo-fi track for you...

[Sets tempo to 85 BPM]
[Creates 3 tracks:]
  - Keys (Drift synth with warm pad)
  - Bass (low sine bass)
  - Drums (laid-back boom bap pattern)

[Fires all clips, starts playback]
```

## Melodies

```
You: Create a C major scale

Claude: [Creates MIDI track, loads Drift, adds notes C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C]
```

```
You: Create a I-V-vi-IV progression in C major

Claude: [Creates track with C, G, Am, F chords over 4 bars]
```

## Drums

```
You: Create a basic house beat at 120 BPM

Claude: [Creates kick on 1-2-3-4, snare on 2-4, hi-hats on 8ths]
```

```
You: Add some swing to the hi-hats

Claude: [Adjusts timing to add groove]
```

## Effects

```
You: Add reverb and delay to the selected track

Claude: [Loads Reverb and Delay audio effects to the track]
```

## Synthesizers vs samplers

When creating MIDI tracks, Claude loads **Drift** by default (a synthesizer that generates sound immediately).

| Type | Examples | Sounds immediately? |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| Synthesizers | Drift, Analog, Wavetable | Yes |
| Samplers | Simpler, Sampler | No (needs samples) |

:::warning
If you're not hearing sound from a MIDI track, check if the instrument is a sampler that needs samples loaded.

## Session view vs arrangement view

Ableton has two main views (press **Tab** to toggle):

| Session view | Arrangement view |
|--------------|------------------|
| Clip grid for launching clips | Linear timeline |
| Great for jamming | Great for mixing |

remix-mcp creates clips in **Session View** by default.

## Ideas to try

- "Create a 4-chord EDM progression and add a sidechain compressor"
- "Build a minimal techno loop with a hypnotic bassline"
- "Create a jazz chord progression with voice leading"
- "Duplicate the current scene and transpose all clips up a 5th"
