## Installing AbletonOSC

### Automatic Installation

```

This copies the AbletonOSC folder to your Ableton Remote Scripts directory:

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| macOS | `~/Music/Ableton/User Library/Remote Scripts/` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Ableton\User Library\Remote Scripts\` |

### Enable in Ableton

1. **Restart** Ableton Live (required after installing scripts)
2. Open **Preferences** (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`)
3. Navigate to **Link/Tempo/MIDI**
4. Under **Control Surface**, select **AbletonOSC**

:::tip
Look for `AbletonOSC: Listening for OSC on port 11000` in the status bar to confirm it's working.
