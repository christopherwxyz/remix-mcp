# Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions.

## Connection Issues

### Connection Timeout

**Symptoms**: Claude reports timeout or cannot connect to Ableton.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check Ableton is running** - The MCP server needs Ableton Live open and running.

2. **Verify AbletonOSC is enabled**:
   - Open Preferences (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`)
   - Go to Link/Tempo/MIDI
   - Ensure AbletonOSC is selected under Control Surface

3. **Check ports are free** - Ports 11000 and 11001 must not be used by other apps:
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   lsof -i :11000
   lsof -i :11001

   # Windows
   netstat -ano | findstr :11000
   ```

4. **Restart both apps** - Sometimes a clean restart of both Ableton and Claude fixes connection issues.

### AbletonOSC Not in Control Surface List

**Symptom**: AbletonOSC doesn't appear in the dropdown.

**Solutions**:

1. **Run the installer**:
   ```bash
   remix-mcp install
   ```

2. **Restart Ableton** - Required after installing new Remote Scripts.

3. **Check installation**:
   ```bash
   remix-mcp status
   ```

4. **Verify the path** - Ensure the Remote Scripts folder exists:
   - macOS: `~/Music/Ableton/User Library/Remote Scripts/AbletonOSC/`
   - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Ableton\User Library\Remote Scripts\AbletonOSC\`

## Audio Issues

### No Sound from MIDI Tracks

**Symptom**: MIDI notes are created but no audio plays.

**Causes & Solutions**:

1. **Empty sampler loaded** - Samplers need samples to make sound:
   ```
   # Use a synth instead
   load_default_instrument
   ```

2. **Track not armed** - The track may need to be armed for monitoring:
   ```
   arm_track(track_index)
   ```

3. **Volume at zero** - Check track and master volume:
   ```
   get_track_volume(track_index)
   set_track_volume(track_index, 0.85)
   ```

4. **Track muted** - Unmute the track:
   ```
   set_track_mute(track_index, false)
   ```

### Synthesizers vs Samplers

Remember the difference:

| Type | Examples | Works Immediately? |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| Synths | Drift, Analog, Wavetable, Operator | Yes |
| Samplers | Simpler, Sampler, Drum Rack | No (need samples) |

**Always prefer synthesizers** for programmatic track creation.

## Claude Configuration

### Server Not Appearing in Claude

**Claude Desktop**:

1. Check config file location:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Verify JSON syntax is valid

3. Restart Claude Desktop after config changes

**Claude Code**:

```bash
# List configured servers
claude mcp list

# Re-add if missing
claude mcp add ableton -- uvx remix-mcp
```

### Tools Not Available

If Claude says it can't find Ableton tools:

1. Restart Claude completely
2. Check the server is properly configured
3. Verify remix-mcp is in your PATH or using full path

## Still Having Issues?

1. **Check remix-mcp status**:
   ```bash
   remix-mcp status
   ```

2. **Enable logging** (for debugging):
   ```bash
   RUST_LOG=debug remix-mcp serve
   ```

3. **Report an issue**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/christopherwxyz/remix-mcp/issues)
